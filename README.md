# Therapy-Chatbot
This program utilizes an Natural Language Processing Transformer model in order to chat with a user.

Here is the dataset: https://github.com/nbertagnolli/counsel-chat
For a good NLP model, this dataset was relatively small, and therefore the model couldn't close to the degree of other great NLP models such as Siri and Alexa.
